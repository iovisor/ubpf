# Platform-Specific eBPF Compilation Considerations

## Issue Description

When compiling eBPF programs with platform-specific preprocessor definitions (e.g., `__aarch64__` vs `__x86_64__`), care must be taken to ensure that the resulting eBPF bytecode is consistent across platforms.

## Problem Example

The following compilation approach can lead to platform-specific issues:

```makefile
ARCH := $(shell uname -m)

ifeq ($(ARCH),aarch64)
  PLATFORM = -D__aarch64__
else
  PLATFORM = -D__x86_64__
endif

CFLAGS = -O2 -target bpf $(PLATFORM)
```

If the C source code uses platform-specific code paths, this can result in different eBPF bytecode being generated for the same logical functionality, leading to runtime issues.

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Avoid platform-specific code in eBPF programs**: Since eBPF programs run in a virtualized environment, they should not depend on the host architecture.

2. **Use fixed-size types**: Always use explicit-width types (`uint32_t`, `uint64_t`) instead of platform-dependent types (`int`, `long`).

3. **Validate bytecode consistency**: When supporting multiple architectures, verify that the generated eBPF bytecode is identical or functionally equivalent.

4. **Use eBPF-specific defines**: Instead of host architecture defines, use eBPF-specific feature detection.

## Example Fix

Instead of:
```c
#ifdef __x86_64__
struct my_data {
    uint32_t value;      // 4 bytes
};
#elif __aarch64__ 
struct my_data {
    uint32_t value;      // 4 bytes  
    char padding[92];    // Why would this be different?
};
#endif
```

Use:
```c
struct my_data {
    uint32_t value;      // Always 4 bytes regardless of host arch
};
```

## Debugging Tips

If you encounter platform-specific issues:

1. Compare the disassembled eBPF bytecode between platforms
2. Look for differences in immediate values or memory offsets
3. Check for platform-specific preprocessor conditions in your source code
4. Verify structure sizes and alignments are consistent

## Related Issues

This pattern was observed in issue #655 where ARM64 and x86-64 generated different immediate values (96 vs 4 bytes) for the same bounds checking logic, leading to buffer overflows on ARM64.
